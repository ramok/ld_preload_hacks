This is a tiny helpers-workarounds for fixing bugs and/or adding new feature to
programs available only in binary form.

By using system linker feature LD_PRELOAD, it's possible intercepts various
system calls which programs use to, and fixing wrong parameters, and/or calling
additional system functions.

hack_fix_reuseaddr/
    Useful for programs which do not use SO_REUSEADDR for tcp sockets.
    As usual such programs has problems with restarting, and fail with error
    "Address already in use".

    This helper intercepts socket() and call additional setsockopt(..SO_REUSEADDR);

    Usage:
    $ LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/hack_fix_reuseaddr.so program

hack_shift_sys_ports/
    Some programs has hardcoded system IP ports (from 0 to 1023), and usually
    can be used by programs with root permissions.

    If you want to run some tests, but without root permissions on unprivileged ports,
    this helper will shift all system IP ports opened by program to unprivileged ports.
    By default ports shifted by 60000.
    For example your program open port 111, with this helper it's will be moved to 60111.

    Usage:
    $ LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/hack_shift_sys_ports.so program
